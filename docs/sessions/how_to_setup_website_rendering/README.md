# How to setup the rendering of the website

This repository automatically deploys
a nicely rendered website upon each change.

## Step 1: Setup deploy branch `gh-pages`

To set this up, we need to click 10x and type 8 characters.

- At the GitHub repository page, click 'Settings'

???- question "Where is that?"

    'Settings' is found at the top-left of the screen

    ![Click on 'Settings'](click_settings.png)

???- question "I do not see 'Settings'"

    This means you do not have the access rights to do so.

- In the 'Settings' menu, click 'Pages'

???- question "Where is that?"

    'Pages' is found at the left menu list

    !['Pages' is found at the left menu list](settings_click_pages.png)

???- question "Where is that?"

    'Branch' is found at the top of the page.

- Try to change the branch to `gh-pages` and fail:
  it will probably say 'No results found'

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Here the branch `gh-pages` cannot be found:

  of which branch is actively displayed.
  It will likely display the word `main`

    Here is the combobox of the actively displayed branch:
